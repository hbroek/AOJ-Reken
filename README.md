# Intro

Solutions for the Advent of Javascript Challenge. Implemented with web dev framework [Reken](https://reken.dev).

Complete 24 Javascript coding challenges from December 1st - 24th. Organized by [selfteach.me](https://selfteach.me/). The challenges evolve around making static web sites/apps interactive.

I used my Web Development framework [Reken](https://reken.dev) to implement the solutions.
