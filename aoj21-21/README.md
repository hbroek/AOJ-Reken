# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a Simplified Budget

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- The user should be able to enter a budget amount. As soon as they move leave the budget amount input field (blur), the summary information should update
- The user should be able to ender a vendor and an amount into the input fields. When they click on the plus button, the amount should get added to the table on the expenses table on the right.
- When an expense is added, the summary information should be updated
- The user should be able to click on the delete an expense button and the row will be removed
- When an expense is removed, the summary information should be updated
- The summary information in the footer should display the income, expenses, and balance
- If the balance is a positive number, the text should be green.
- If the balance is a negative number, the text should be red.

2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like [React](http://react.com), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, consider purchasing the [Advent of CSS](http://adventofcss.com) solutions, where Amy explains exactly how to build this.
- Add animation as the information loads, exits, and updates.
- Add form validation
- Show and hide the bottom summary bar.
- Add the ability to edit an expense
