# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a sorting table.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- Display 10 entries of data preloaded into **app.js**
- Sort columns ascending or descending by ID, Name, Email Address, and Job Title
  - When sorting ascending the top arrow in the table header will be a darker blue and the bottom arrow will be a lighter blue. You can update the style by adding a class of `ascending` to the `button`. See line 22 in the index.html starter file as an example.
  - When sorting descending the bottom arrow in the table header will be a dark blue and the top arrow will be a lighter blue. You can update the style by adding a class of `descending` to the `button`.

- Users can view the next page of data (if you’re not on the last page already) by clicking on the next arrow (bottom right).
- Users can view the previous page of data (if you’re not on the first page) by clicking on the previous arrow (bottom right).

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like [React](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5u4nz4nq7a0umqw04a8/p8hehqu9gen3pkhq/aHR0cHM6Ly9yZWFjdGpzLm9yZy8=), [Vue](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5u4nz4nq7a0umqw04a8/x0hph3un9m5r4rh5/aHR0cHM6Ly92dWVqcy5vcmcv), or [Svelte](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5u4nz4nq7a0umqw04a8/6qhehoupn4mk35uo/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdmVsdGUuZGV2Lw==). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, consider purchasing the [Advent of CSS](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5u4nz4nq7a0umqw04a8/kkhmh2u86pkdoefl/aHR0cDovL2FkdmVudG9mY3NzLmNvbQ==) solutions, where Amy explains exactly how to build this.
- Provide the ability to add a new entry.
- Make the information persistent across sessions, either by storing the information in local storage or connecting to a database.
